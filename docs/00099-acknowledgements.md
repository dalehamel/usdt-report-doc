# Acknowledgments

This is a report is meant to summarize my own research and experiments in this area, but the experience and research that went into making it all possible bears mentioning.

- Brendan Gregg [@brendangregg] for his contributions to improving the accessibility of tracing tools throughout the industry
- Alastair Robertson [@ajor] for creating bpftrace, and personally for reviewing the PRs I've submitted and offering insightful feedback
- Matheus Marchini [@mmarchini] for his contributions to USDT tracing and feedback in reviews
- Willian Gaspar [@williangaspar] for his contributions to iovisor and works featured here
- Jon Haslam [@tyroguru] for his assistance and feedback on pull requests for USDT functionality in bpftrace
- Teng Qin [@palmtenor] for reviewing my BCC patches with laser eyes
- Yonghong Song [@yonghong-song] for reviewing my BCC patches with laser eyes
- Julia Evans [@jvns] for her amazing zines on tracing, rendering advanced concepts in accessible and creative formats, and her technical contributions to the tracing community and rbspy
- Lorenzo Fontana [@fntlnz] for his work on creating and promoting kubetl-trace
- Leo Di Donato [@leodido] for his work feedback and and insights on pull requests

I'd also like to specifically extend appreciation to Facebook and Netflix's Engineering staff working on tracing and kernel development, for their continued contributions and leadership in the field of Linux tracing and contributions to eBPF, as well as the entire iovisor group.
