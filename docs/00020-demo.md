# Tracing "Hello World"

```{.ruby include=examples/helloworld.rb}
```

This is a basic ruby script that demonstrates the basic use of static tracepoints in Ruby, using the library `ruby-static-tracing` Ruby gem, covered later.

// FIXME add ruby-static-tracing repo to bibliography.

This simplistic program will loop indefinitely, printing `Not Enabled` every second. This represents the Ruby program going on it's merry way, doing what it's supposed to be doing - pretend that it is running actual application code. The application isn't spending any time executing probes, all it is doing is checking if the probe is enabled. Since the probe isn't enabled, it continues with business as usual. The cost of checking if a probe is enabled is extraordinarily low (~5 micro seconds).
