# bpftrace

bpftrace [@bpftrace] is an emerging new tool that is based on eBPF support added to version 4.1 of the linux kernel. While rapidly under development, it already supports much of dtrace's functionality.

You can use bpftrace in production systems to attach to and summarize data from trace points similarly to with dtrace.

For more details for bpftrace, check out its own reference guide [@bpftrace-reference-guide] and this great article [@joyful-bikeshedding-bpftrace].

You can bpftrace programs by specifying a string with the `-e` flag, or by running a bpftrace script (conventionally ending in `.bt`) directly.
